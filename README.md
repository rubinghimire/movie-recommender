# Movie Recommender
- A movie recommender system that returns a list of recommended movies based on the user's input movie.
It loads pre-existing data sets and performs collaborative filtering to come up with its recommendations.
- Please read through the heavily commented app.py to understand the filtering logic.
- The user input must exactly match the movie title in movies.csv to get recommendations based on filtering, 
otherwise, the server returns a list of similar movies to the input movie calculated by using a similarity score.
